## Project Overview
The IRC Official Website aims to provide:
- Club information, updates, and announcements.
- A showcase of projects, achievements, and members.
- Smooth navigation and responsive design for all devices.

Our goal is to **maintain clean code, modular components, and collaborative development**.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, TailwindCSS (or your chosen CSS framework)  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB (Atlas or local)  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
- **Deployment:** Vercel / Netlify (Frontend), Render / Heroku (Backend)  

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- Git installed
- MongoDB account (if using Atlas) or local MongoDB setup

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PseudoSwayam/IRC_Website.git
cd IRC_Website/
```

### Git Workflow

We follow a feature-branch workflow branching from dev (never commit directly to main):

**1. Switch to dev branch and pull latest updates**
```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
```

**2. Create a new feature branch**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/<short-description>
```
Replace <short-description> with a concise name describing your feature/task.

**3. Make changes to code, frontend, or backend as required.**

**4. Stage and commit changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: <short description of change/addition>"
```
Use conventional commit messages for clarity (e.g., feat: add navbar component, fix: resolve login bug).

** 5.	Push your branch to GitHub**
```bash
git push -u origin feature/<short-description>
```

## Pull Request (PR) Guidelines

### After pushing your feature branch:
	1.	Go to your repository on GitHub.
	2.	GitHub will suggest: ‚ÄúCompare & pull request‚Äù for your branch.
	3.	Set the base branch to dev (never main).
	4.	Add details:
	‚Ä¢	Clear PR title
	‚Ä¢	Description outlining your work
	‚Ä¢	Mention related issues (if any)
	5.	Assign reviewers: Notify the project lead or relevant team members in the WhatsApp group.

Ensure your code is reviewed and approved before merging to dev.

---

## Code Style & Conventions
	‚Ä¢	Use camelCase for variables and functions.
	‚Ä¢	Use PascalCase for React components.
	‚Ä¢	Keep modular and reusable components.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure consistent indentation (2 spaces recommended for JS/React).
	‚Ä¢	Comment complex code for clarity.
	‚Ä¢	Run linting and format checks before committing.

---

## Contact / Team Communication
	‚Ä¢	All development discussions, clarifications, and reviews should be communicated in the team WhatsApp group.
	‚Ä¢	Tag the Project Manager / Lead for approvals or issues.
