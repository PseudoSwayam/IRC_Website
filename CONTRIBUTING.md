## Getting Started

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PseudoSwayam/IRC_Website.git
cd IRC_Website/
```

### Git Workflow

We follow a feature-branch workflow branching from dev (never commit directly to main):

**1. Switch to dev branch and pull latest updates**
```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
```

**2. Create a new feature branch**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/<short-description>
```
Replace <short-description> with a concise name describing your feature/task.

**3. Make changes to code, frontend, or backend as required.**

**4. Stage and commit changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: <short description of change/addition>"
```
Use conventional commit messages for clarity (e.g., feat: add navbar component, fix: resolve login bug).

** 5.	Push your branch to GitHub**
```bash
git push -u origin feature/<short-description>
```

## Pull Request (PR) Guidelines

### After pushing your feature branch:
	1.	Go to your repository on GitHub.
	2.	GitHub will suggest: ‚ÄúCompare & pull request‚Äù for your branch.
	3.	Set the base branch to dev (never main).
	4.	Add details:
	‚Ä¢	Clear PR title
	‚Ä¢	Description outlining your work
	‚Ä¢	Mention related issues (if any)
	5.	Assign reviewers: Notify the project lead or relevant team members in the WhatsApp group.

Ensure your code is reviewed and approved before merging to dev.
